    <h1> MY POEMS </h1>
    <button onclick="fun1('d1')" style="background-color: #ff66b3;"><b>Rhyming choices</b></button><br>
    <div id = "d1" class = 'poem' style="display:none;">
        To unconditionally love or unapologetically hate<br>To tenaciously try or to accept fate<br>To stand still  and fight or to simply walk away<br>To pave a new path or to choose the most used way<br>To speak up my words out or mask up with a smile<br>To be contented with my journey or walk an extra mile<br>To loop over regrets or to trust the decisions<br>To be a rebel or to follow the traditions<br>To please the people or to speak out loud<br>To lead the people or to follow the crowd<br>To retain one's self or to adapt to change<br>To give it all away or to expect something in exchange<br>Between making a choice and leaving it up to the time<br>All I chose is to write a Rhyme<br></div>
    <button onclick="fun1('d2')" style="background-color: #8c66ff;"><b>Somewhere between the End and Start</b></button><br>
    <div id = "d2" class = 'poem' style="display:none;">
    Somewhere between being held and holding on,<br> 
    I was writing down my desires to fly.<br>
    Somewhere between fighting for and letting go,<br> 
    I was contemplating my power to try.<br>
    Somewhere between breaking down and staying strong,<br>
    I was reconsidering my reasons to cry.<br>
    Somewhere between longing to climb and craving to rest,<br>
    I was filling myself with the regrets of the days that passed by.<br>
    Somewhere between wanting to do all that I ever wanted to and accepting my inability to undo what I had done,<br>
    I reached my time to die.<br>
    I never wanted another chance to live my life in a different way,<br>
    for, I still had no answer for the question "WHY?"!<br>
    </div>
    <button onclick="fun1('d3')" style="background-color: #66d9ff;"><b>Beauty of an insane obsession</b></button><br>
    <div id = "d3" class = 'poem' style="display:none;">
    It was with you I learned memories could also be the unreal realities I always rooted for years,<br>
    A smile could also be a subtle representation of pain that couldn't be expressed enough with tears.<br>
    With you, any conversation could be an infinite pause and unbroken silence,<br>
    Hurting could also be so soft and far from any form of violence.<br>
    You flowed through all of my scars and wounds that I had to earn,<br>
    Making each one of those into a lesson and made me learn.<br>
    Every time I ran away from reality I came closer to you,<br>
    I knew our bond was always too good to be true.<br>
    Dear self, no matter what I made you go through,<br>
    You always stayed for me to keep loving you.<br>
    Through all these lines I may sound self-obsessed or insane,<br>
    But it is this insanity that gives me the power to start my day all again.
</div>
    <button onclick="fun1('d4')" style="background-color: #b3ff66;"><b>From the one</b></button><br>
    <div id = "d4" class = 'poem' style="display:none;">
    A deprived past was my nonstopping thirst’s seed<br>
    Maybe I couldn't differentiate between need and greed<br>
    I wanted to fly so high so thno one could ever reach me<br>
    In return, the pain of loneliness was all time had to teach me<br><br>
     
    There were chances I wanted to take<br>
    There were choices I wanted to make<br>
    My only fear was, what if things don’t turn the way I wanted it to be<br>
    And then there were those smiles I fake<br>
    Putting my own happiness at stake<br>
    Hoping that it was not all that I ever had to see<br><br>
     
    I dreamt so long that I had no time to live<br>
    A bald head and lost sight was all that time had to give<br><br>
     
    If I could count all the days I truly smiled<br>
    It could hardly cross a hundred<br>
    And now I am just sorry to all the pages of my life<br>
    that remains unread
</div>
    <button onclick="fun1('d5')" style="background-color: #ffff66;"><b>Beauty to admire</b></button><br>
    <div id = "d5" class = 'poem' style="display:none;">
    I wish <br>
    I could carve your eyes<br>
    Out of that perfectly shaped face<br>
    Safely protect it forever in a golden case<br>
    Look at it every time I feel low<br>
    Feel the spark that gets me go<br>
    Cherish it's presence every second<br>
    And poccess it with pride<br>
    Till the very end<br><br>

    But then I realise,<br>
    Your eyes without your smile<br>
    Is just like an empty Nyle<br>
    How ever big and large it<br>
    The current in it is always a miss<br>
    Beauty shouldn't be pocessed just admired<br>
    And so will I do to your soul high and fired
